            Longer notes about my journey into frontend development, UI/UX and building a calm,
            international career — written mostly for myself, and for anyone walking a similar path.

            <p class="blog-meta">Journey • Personal Story</p>
            <p class="blog-excerpt">
              For years I worked in hospital information systems and patient registration — inside
              complex workflows, long queues and very noisy environments. This experience made me
              care deeply about clarity, empathy and stability in every interface I touch.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-excerpt">
              In this post, I write about how that background pushed me towards frontend
              development, why I care about calm design and how I’m slowly building a new career
              step by step.

            <h3>Designing Calm Interfaces</h3>
            <p class="blog-meta">UI/UX • Principles</p>
            <p class="blog-excerpt">
              “Calm” is a word I use a lot. For me it means: enough spacing to breathe, typography
              that doesn’t shout, and flows that don’t force the user to think about the interface
              when they are already tired from life.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-excerpt">
              Here I collect small principles I follow when designing landing pages and portfolios:
              hierarchy, rhythm, and soft contrast instead of aggressive visuals.

            <p class="blog-meta">Career • Global Talent</p>
            <p class="blog-excerpt">
              I’m slowly preparing for a future where I can work remotely for international clients
              and maybe move to the UK or Europe. My portfolio is not only a collection of projects,
              but also a narrative about who I am and what I care about.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-excerpt">
              In this post, I reflect on the kind of projects I’m investing in, how I want to use
              my blog as proof of my journey, and what “global, but calm” means for my career.
